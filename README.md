# presentations

Right now presentations require only a server that will serve http file (you can just serve them as files, but on some systems you can have problems with non-English letters - better check earlier!). Tested on http-server, but should work on any you pick.

1. Go to presentation folder
2. `http-server -a localhost`
3. ???
4. Profit.

Feel free to reuse them as you see fit, thou credit/getting in touch would be nice. If there is a language indicator that mean presentation in not in English, but in some other language (PL - Polish, for example).
