					<h2>Elixir Security 101</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						Some basics about security, mostly on Elixir, but some agnostic knowledge as well.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<ul>
						<li>What not to do in Elixir</li>
						<li>Ecto</li>
						<li>Plug</li>
						<li>Phoenix</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Generally one weakness in Elixir (also in Erlang), what is Ecto and what does ecto provide,
						What is plug and what it provides, what is phoenix and what it provides
					</aside>

					<h3>String.to_atom/1<br />vs<br />String.to_existing_atom/1</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Every process is isolated, so process crash should not influence the rest of the system <br />
						Every process has it's own GC, so it's also safe. <br />
						Atoms are represented by their values - :ok's value is :ok <br />
						This is why atoms are global and not GC'd - kind of shared <br />
						There's also limit on atoms - default (2^20) 1,048,576 - going over will crash the VM. <br />
						Why crashing VM is bad? DoS + possibility on crashdump leak.
					</aside>

					<h3>Ecto</h3>
					<ul>
						<li> Strong protections by default </li>
						<li> Problematic functions: Repo.query, Repo.fragment </li>
						<li> Ecto.Changeset.cast <3 </li>
						<li> transactions can lead to ACIDRain attacks </li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Ecto is DB adapter for Elixir, but also Changeset for validations and tracking changes <br />
						If you're not using Repo.query/Repo.fragment you're generally set - it's virtually impossible to inject sql code <br />
						But if you're using Repo.query/Repo.fragment you're writing string - beware! Especially that fragment can send ANY expression to the db! <br />
						Repo query("select * from users where name = $1", [name]) <br />
						Ecto.Adapter.SQL.Query allows for passing string - try that from user input ;) <br />
						Third parameter is a list of permitted fields - anything not listed here is ignored <br />

					<h3> Plug </h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Plug is meant to be a generic adapter for different web servers.<br />
						Plug also defines how differnet components should be "plugged" together<br />

					</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Plug.CSRFProtection</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Compare parameter/token against token in session</li>
							<li>Update token in session before response</li>
							<li>GET requests are not protected</li>
							<li>Protection agains leaking tokens to external domains</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							CSRF - cross site request forgery - using logged user to perform actions that should not be performed <br />
							The token may be sent by the request either via the params with key "_csrf_token" or a header with name "x-csrf-token". <br />
							GET are not protected as they should not have side effects <br />
							But this plug fobids any GET JavaScript that is not XHR/AJAX <br />
							form_for/generate_token_for/1 - can be used to specify (sub)domain
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Plug.SSL</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>check (and update) `conn.scheme`</li>
							<li>redirect from HTTP to HTTPS</li>
							<li>set HSTS header on HTTPS</li>
							<li>Be careful! HSTS will lock in HTTPS for the current domain!</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							conn.scheme holds http/https info <br />
							conn is a data structure for request/response <br />
							HSTS - HTTP Strict Transport Security is a header that will prevent any communications from being sent over HTTP <br />
							Last point can become painfull during developement/testing!
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Plug.Upload and Plug.Parsers</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							Uploaded files are potentially dangerious user input - can put server and other users at risk (if files made available) <br />
							don't trust uploader Content-Type header/file extension <br />
							Perform scans/analytics
						</aside>

					<h3>Phoenix</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Phoenix.Controller.protect_from_forgery</li>
						<li>Phoenix.Controller.put_secure_browser_headers</li>
						<li>Phoenix.Endpoint `force_ssl` option</li>
						<li>`filter_parameters` Phoenix.Logger option</li>
						<li>Remember to validate inputs on both sides!</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						1. Basically CSRFProtection - wrapper around that <br />
						2. Contents varies by Phoenix release, worth noting that e.g. x-frame-options - prod only The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a frame, iframe or object . Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.<br />
						3. Injects Plug.SSL, so you don't need to add Plug.SSL to your endpoint
						4. We don't want to show passwords in log. Sunstring match, default "password", you can configure to whatever
						5. Front only for UX, backend for security!
